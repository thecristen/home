The other day I was on a campus shuttle, and a person asked if we were going to Lechmere.

"No," the driver told her. "That's the EZRide. You need to get out here and take that one."

"Which one is that?"

"That's the blue one."

"Oh. Which color is that?" English evidently is not this person's first language.

While the driver kept unhelpfully specifying the blue one, I considered pointing out the nearest blue-colored thing as a reference. We were next to a long column of transit-related signs -- all white signs except for the second one, which was a bold blue. But it wasn't a sign for the EZRide shuttle. The blue sign directs you to the very shuttle we're on!
